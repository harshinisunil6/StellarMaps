# StellarMaps
Creating stellar maps using quadratic limb darkening coefficients. Transit light curve plots are from BATMAN, created by Laura Kreidberg, which is code that allows for input parameters, including limb-darkening to produce theoretical transit curves.  


## Usage 

```python
import LimbsStellarMap as lsm
lsm.intensity_imshow(.4,.2, 'intensity')
```
